# Execution Plan: Shop Assistant IPS adoption bootstrap

```yaml
id: EP-TASK-001-bootstrap-service
status: validated
owner: project owner
created: 2026-08-30
last_updated: 2026-08-30
completeness_level: validated
upstream:
  - ../11_tasks/TASK-001-bootstrap-service.md
  - ../22_goal_impact/GOAL-IMPACT-TASK-001.md
downstream:
  - ../12_validation/VAL-TASK-001-bootstrap-service.md
```

## upstream traceability

This plan implements `../11_tasks/TASK-001-bootstrap-service.md`, which in turn advances `../22_goal_impact/GOAL-IMPACT-TASK-001.md`.

## scope

- Root IPS artifacts
- Protected governance docs
- Bootstrap task chain docs
- ips-adoption.json integration review

## non-goals

- No service code, schema, or deployment changes
- No resolution of the open owner-gated live checkout smoke follow-up

## project invariants

This plan preserves SA-INV-001..005 by documenting them, not altering them.

## sensitive-data handling

No secrets or user search content are read, generated, or committed; only architectural facts drawn from README/BUSINESS/SYSTEM/AGENTS/TASKS/STATE and non-secret .env.example variable names are used.

## contract validation plan

Not applicable; no public API or schema contract changes are made by this plan.

## replay and determinism plan

Not applicable; this plan does not change the billing/entitlement callback idempotency logic or search/refinement pipeline.

## files to inspect

- README.md
- BUSINESS.md
- SYSTEM.md
- AGENTS.md
- AGENT_OPERATIONS.md
- TASKS.md
- STATE.json
- .env.example

## files to create

## files to modify

- README.md
- BUSINESS.md
- SYSTEM.md
- AGENTS.md
- AGENT_OPERATIONS.md
- CLAUDE.md
- TASKS.md
- STATE.json

## files that must not be modified

- docs/DEVELOPMENT.md, docs/API.md, docs/INTEGRATION.md, docs/DEPLOYMENT.md, docs/MODEL_AND_ROLE_MANAGEMENT.md
- docs/12_validation/VALIDATION_DEBT.md (a pre-existing, differently-pathed file left untouched)
- Any service source code under src/
- k8s manifests
- deploy.config.sh

## implementation steps

- Read all existing real content in root docs, TASKS.md, STATE.json, and .env.example
- Run the non-destructive scaffolder for any missing files
- Reformat every required artifact into validator-required sections using only observed facts
- Complete the integration review for all 16 capabilities, confirming actual code/env usage
- Run the planning validator and fix all reported findings
- Commit directly to main in this repository only

## parallel execution

Single-owner sequential execution; no parallel lanes required for this documentation bootstrap.

## blockers

- None identified during this bootstrap; the pre-existing owner-gated live checkout smoke follow-up remains an open project blocker, not a bootstrap blocker.

## test plan

- No code tests apply; validation is via the IPS adoption validator only.

## validation plan

Run the IPS adoption validator in the project root and confirm no unresolved findings: `python3 ../intent-preservation-system/scripts/validate_adoption_profile.py --root . --phase planning`. See `../12_validation/VAL-TASK-001-bootstrap-service.md` for recorded evidence.

## gate commands

- `python3 ../intent-preservation-system/scripts/validate_adoption_profile.py --root . --phase planning`

## documentation updates

- All files listed under files to create/modify above.

## rollback plan

Revert the single onboarding commit with `git revert` if any adoption artifact is found to misstate project facts; no runtime behavior is affected.

## handoff

Handoff evidence and traceability confirmation are recorded in `../12_validation/VAL-TASK-001-bootstrap-service.md`, which links back to `../11_tasks/TASK-001-bootstrap-service.md`.

## completion checklist

- Planning validator passes
- All protected docs carry approval evidence
- Commit made to main with descriptive message
- Final report delivered with files-changed count and commit hash
